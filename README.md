# Flutter-World-Time-App
This is my first kinda useful app I created using Flutter

This app was created using Flutter by Google and the IDE used was VS Code

This app has 3 screens, namely the Loading screen, the Home Screen and the Location Screen

The Loading Screen is the first screen to show and is visble until the data on the Home Screen initializes.

The default time has been set to Berlin.

Will work on adding functionality to detect timezone and change time accordingly for the app initialization.

The background wallpaper and the UI Color changes alongwith the time in the different places. 
It will show a blue sky wallpaper for daytime with black text while the background is a black wallpaper and the UI color is white when it is nighttime.

The location screen contains the various cities the app supports to show times, and it will redirect to home screen after selecting a particular city and updating the time.
